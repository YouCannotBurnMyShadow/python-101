      ##Python In A Nutshell

      * Invented by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the late 1980s
      * Very easy to read syntax
        * Uses plain English for many functions and operators
        * Uses four spaces of indentation for code blocks
        * Has a comprehensive style guide: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
        * No unnecessary special characters,<br />
          like semicolons at the end of the line

      * Python is an **object oriented** language
      * This is pretty hard to explain...
      * ...you will learn later what this means ;)

      ##Python In A Nutshell

      * Python is not a compiled language, but an **interpreted** language
      * This means, in order to run a Python script,<br />
        you need to install the Python interpreter
      * Pro: You never need to compile your code.
      * Con: If you want to install your software on other<br />
        people's computers, they need to install the interpreter as well.

      * Python is a **dynamically typed** language
      * This means, you don't need to define a type when you create variables
      * Pro: You can write prototypes and scripts very quickly
      * Con: There is no compiler that can warn you about common errors
      * However: You should write tests anyways. If you do, you will find most errors

      * Python is not the fastest language
      * If you want to write a game, better use C
      * Python is not the safest language
      * If you want to fly a rocket to Mars, ask Elon Musk what he is using
      * Python is a very readable, learnable and maintainable language
      * If you want to build a business, use Python
