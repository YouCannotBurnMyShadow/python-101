      ##Modules

      * Every ***.py** file is a Python module
      * To keep your code easy to read and easy to maintain, you should split it into small modules
      * When two ***.py** files are in the same folder, they can import each other
      * When you **import** a module, Python will try to execute all the code in that module
      * This means, if you would import our **birthday.py** module, the import would crash
        * Because the birthday program requires a command line argument

      <ul>
        <li>We already have a few useful functions (<em>get_weekday</em> and <em>get_future_date</em>)</li>
        <li>It would be grat if we could import them in our Python programs without crashing</li>
        <li>Create a new file <strong>birth_date.py</strong> and move the functions into that file:</li>
      </ul>

<pre><code data-trim>
import datetime
from settings import BIRTHDAY

def get_future_date(age):
    date_object = datetime.datetime.strptime(BIRTHDAY, '%Y-%m-%d')
    future_date = datetime.date(
        date_object.year + age,
        date_object.month,
        date_object.day
    )
    return future_date

def get_weekday(weekday_number):
    weekdays = [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday",
    ]
    return weekdays[weekday_number - 1]
</code></pre>

      <ul>
        <li>We didn't really add any new code, we just moved old code into a new file</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exercise</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Create another new file <strong>settings.py</strong>:</li>
      </ul>

<pre><code>BIRTHDAY = "1982-09-08"</code></pre>

      <ul>
        <li>This is just to demonstrate how your programs could have settings files</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Finally, remove the code that we have just moved from <strong>birthday.py</strong>:</li>
