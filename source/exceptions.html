      ##Exception Handling

      * Sometimes you can't avoid program crashes
      * Especially when your program accepts user input
      * All users are evil! They always try to use your programs in ways you never expected :)
      * You can use **try-except blocks** to **handle exceptions**:
<pre><code>value1 = 1
value2 = 0
try:
    result = value1 / value2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("ERROR: You can't divide by zero")
</code></pre>
      * The output should be:
        <pre><code>> ERROR: You can't divide by zero</code></pre>
    </script>
