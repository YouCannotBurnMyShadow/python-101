      ##The If-Statement

      * You need to control the **program flow** in your programs
      * That means, if some condition is True, then certain code should be executed
      * If it is not True, either nothing should happen or some other code should be executed
      * The If-Statement helps you to do this:
        <pre><code>if 1 > 2:
    print("One is bigger than two")
    # This code is actually never reached
else:
    print("One is not bigger than two")
        </code></pre>
      * The output should be:
        <pre><code>> One is not bigger than two</code></pre>
    </script>

      ##Type-casting

      * Sometimes a variable is a String but you actually want a Number
      * You can try to **cast the string into a number**:
<pre><code>my_string = "5"
my_number = int(my_string)
print(my_number)
</code></pre>
      * The output should be:
        <pre><code>> 5</code></pre>
