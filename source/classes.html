      ##Classes

      * Python is an **Object Oriented Programming** language
      * That means, all data types in Python are classes and objects behind the scenes
      * A **Class** basically describes a certain thing in the world
      * A class can have **Class Attributes**. Those are just variables
      * A class can have **Class Methods**. Those are just functions
      * In order to use a class, you have to create an **Instance** of the class
      * These instances are called **Objects**
      * Don't panic! None of the above will make any sense to you until you try and use it ;)

      ##Classes

      * Another way to think about classes is this:
      * They encapsulate all the code that solves a specific problem
      * They keep track of their own state (via their attributes)
      * They offer you functions to manipulate their own state
      * You could say that modules already do the same
        * That is correct, but there is more to classes
        * Classes support **Inheritance**, which unfortunately is too complex for this workshop

      <ul>
        <li>Let's try to create a <strong>BirthDate</strong> class for our program.</li>
        <li>Change the code in <strong>birth_date.py</strong> like this:</li>
      </ul>

<pre><code data-trim>
